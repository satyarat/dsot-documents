# Preamble

## Purpose

This document outlines the intentions and purpose of the Decentralized Source of Truth (DSoT) mechanism. DSoT aims to provide a decentralized, distributed, and unsupervised system for establishing and maintaining a verifiable *Source-of-Truth*.

The Preamble describes the intentions and purpose of this digital mechanism. Specifications should not deviate from what is stated or implied herein.

## Vision

The goal is to introduce a transparent, tamper‑resistant medium that can play a role in enhancing the socio‑economic fabric of the world by:

* providing **universal access to a single, trust worthy source of truth**.
* providing the ability for **permanent data persistence** while remaining highly available.
* preventing **unauthorized manipulation or misuse** of the stored information.
* keeping the system **simple and resilient**, thereby enabling rapid adoption and minimal maintenance.

## Required Capabilities

To realize this vision, the system must provide a secure, tamper-proof environment for data exchange and persistence, devoid of centralized control and supervisory mechanisms. Specifically, the following capabilities are essential:

* **Immutable Data Storage:**  Data must be permanently stored and unalterable, ensuring a verifiable historical record
* **Data Availability:**  Data should remain consistently accessible over extended periods
* **Tamper Resistance:** The system should be resistant to unauthorized modification or corruption of data
* **Prevention of Misuse:**  Mechanisms should be in place to prevent unintended or malicious utilization of the system

## Design Fundamentals

**Architectural Approach:** The most effective implementation leverages distributed computing resources provided by the system's users. Participation involves a limited contribution of computing resources, fostering a collaborative and self-sustaining network.

**Design Philosophy:** Simplicity is paramount. An uncomplicated design promotes both operational efficiency and resilience. The core function remains the provision of a verifiable Source of Truth, with any auxiliary functionalities designed to enhance robustness, usability, and trustworthiness.

**Binary Distribution and Network Formation:** Given the public domain and transparent nature of the DSoT mechanism, a secure and verifiable process for creating and distributing software binaries is crucial. An "ether" (network) will be formed with a combination of a secure binary forge and the distribution of its binaries, enabling the existence of independent and geographically diverse networks with varying degrees of influence.

## Core Principles

The following principles of have been determined for this system, which shall be used as the foundation of the system design.

1. **No external control** – The system is to be closed to any dominion, influence or alterations
2. **Immutablity** – Once written, data cannot be altered or deleted by users
3. **Integrity** – Output is not to be affected by data corruption
4. **Persistence** – Data can potentially become persistent for as long as required
5. **Purpose‑bound use** – The system should exist solely to deliver the Source of Truth mechanism
6. **Strict access control** – Data is readable or writable only through the system’s defined interfaces
7. **User friendly APIs** – Clear, minimal APIs enable secure message exchange for end users
8. **Simplicity first** – The architecture would rely on the simplest possible design and operations to maximize efficiency and resilience

## Summary

The intended outcome is a masterless *Source of Truth* system, that promises data integrity, data persistence and high availability in all situations.
