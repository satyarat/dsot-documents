This is a draft documentation for the design and specifications of **Decentralized Source of Truth (DSoT)**, a mechanism to persist source of truth (**SoT**) over distributed and potentially connected nodes all running the same set of software components. An introduction to this was presented [here](https://satyarat.github.io/home).

This document will be used to define, refine and lock the design and specifications for this software mechanism.

Any and all parts of these documents will be open for review and change as long as it adheres to the intentions of developing this mechanism (formalized in the Preamble). Most of the content before the specifications are my preliminary approaches and concepts. Changes to them will eventually affect the specifications documents.

<u>High-level overview of design and development process</u>:
