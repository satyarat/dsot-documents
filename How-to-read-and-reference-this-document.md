## 🧭 Navigation Guide

### 🔹 Foundational Sections

| Section | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| [Preamble](Preamble.md) | Establishes the project's guiding principles and development philosophy. |
| [Design Concept](Design-Concept.md) | Outlines the high-level architectural vision, grounded in the Preamble. |
| [Definition of Terms](Definition-of-Terms.md) | Defines key terminology used throughout the documentation. |

### 🔹 Planning and Modeling

| Section | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| [Software Components](Software-Components.md) | Lists the modular software components required for implementation. |
| [Entities](Entities.md) | Defines core data models and entities for system functionality. |
| [Design Details](Design-Details.md) | Elaborates on the design concept with detailed specifications. This section remains fluid to accommodate iterative refinement. |

### 🔹 Specification and Implementation

| Section | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| [Functional Specification Document (FSD)](fsd/Functional-Specification-Document.md) | Documents precise functional requirements. |
| [Technical Specification Document (TSD)](tsd/Technical-Specification-Document.md) | Details technical implementation strategies derived from the FSD. |
| [API Documentation](apis/API.md) | Defines system interfaces, including endpoints, formats, and usage guidelines. |

> Each specification section may include nested sub-sections with individual status indicators to reflect progress and readiness.
